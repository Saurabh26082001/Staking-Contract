# Staking-Contract

A staking contract is a type of smart contract on a blockchain network that enables users to earn rewards
by locking up their cryptocurrency tokens for a certain period of time. 
The process of staking involves holding and locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet or a smart contract, 
in order to support the network and validate transactions.
